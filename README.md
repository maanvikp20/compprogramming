# 🧠 Competitive Programming

A collection of my solutions to competitive programming problems across multiple platforms, written in **Python**.

## 📁 Structure

```
compprogramming/
├── codewars/         # Solutions to Codewars kata challenges
└── projecteuler/     # Solutions to Project Euler math problems
```

## 🌐 Platforms

### [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
Codewars is a platform where developers train on coding challenges called *kata*. Problems range from beginner to advanced across topics like algorithms, data structures, string manipulation, and more.

### [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
Project Euler is a series of mathematical and computational problems that require a blend of math insight and programming to solve efficiently. Problems progressively increase in difficulty.

## 🛠️ Language

All solutions are written in **Python 3**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any solution locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/maanvikp20/compprogramming.git
cd compprogramming

# Run a solution
python3 codewars/solution_name.py
python3 projecteuler/problem_001.py
```

## 📈 Goals

- Sharpen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Practice mathematical reasoning through Project Euler
- Improve Python proficiency through consistent practice
